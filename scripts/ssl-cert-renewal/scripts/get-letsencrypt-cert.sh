# Example using Certbot with DNS challenge (Requires a DNS plugin)
# Adjust plugin and provider according to your DNS provider, e.g.:
# certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email $EMAIL --agree-tos --no-eff-email -d $DOMAIN

# This is a placeholder command; replace with actual certbot command and provider details.
# For production, you'd likely automate DNS TXT records. For simplicity here:
echo "Simulating certificate issuance for $DOMAIN..."
sleep 2
echo "Certificate obtained for $DOMAIN"

# Simulate PFX creation
PFX_PATH="$(dirname $0)/$DOMAIN.pfx"
# In reality, you'd combine cert and key from Certbot's output directory.
# Example (if you had cert.pem and key.pem):
# openssl pkcs12 -export -out $PFX_PATH -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -password pass:
touch $PFX_PATH
